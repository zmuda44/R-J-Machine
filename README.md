  ## Description: 
  A mockup website for the fictional R & J Custom Machine Shop. Users of the website are able to fill out a form to receive an estimate. The estimate form contains several fields and features including email checking and calendar dates. Employees are then able to log into the backend of the site for administration duties. Employees are able to view, edit or delete estimate requests.

  ## Note:
  The username and password to the backend is found at the bottom of the admin page. This emulates an employee login.

  ## Upcoming:
  Soon employees will have their own custom login created from admin. Admin login will be for top level functions such as managing employees. Regular employee login will be able to perform CRUD operations on submitted projects, but admin login will have all of the functionality of a regular employee plus admin duties.
